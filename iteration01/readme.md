# Iteration 01
This folder contains the first prototype of Sip 'n' Study. The purpose of this first iteration was to familiarize the team with basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as [Google's Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). Currently, the site possesses no database functionality, and as such, full database functionality is of highest priority for the next iteration (e.g. adding accounts & restaurants, editing restaurant details, etc.) The team plans on exploring the potential in using Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to tackle this problem. Additionally, the team wishes to further harness the power of the Maps API, using features such as user location. Lastly, the team intends on exploring using the JavaScript library [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build the user interface.
**Note: This iteration is a throwaway prototype. This code is deprecated, and should not be built upon. However, it can be used as reference. Iteration 02 will be built from scratch.**
